# scoppy scope

scoppy_scope is a project of mine, where i try to fit a custom small form-factor 2 channel osciloscope to a Thinkpad T430's smart card reader bay.

Project is currently in development, the frontend is tested to be fully working without the use of the range switching IC. 

This project was inspired by the [Scoppy oscilloscope and logic analyzer project](https://github.com/fhdm-dev/scoppy) which sadly only supports Android devices as of this date. 

The digital part of the project, including part of the schematic and footprints, has been taken from the [Adafruit QT Py RP2040](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-QT-Py-RP2040-PCB)

As of right now, the PCB is close to finished. The main focus will be shifted to the software side of the project.
